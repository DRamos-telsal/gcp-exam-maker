## Examtopics Professional Cloud Network Engineer_20 question #25

You are implementing firewall controls to protect your computer resources in a newly created VPC. To make the protection process easier to manage and control, you've defined the hierarchical firewall policies, global network firewall policies, and VPC firewall rules. The configuration of rules defines the following characteristics:

• The hierarchical firewall policy, bound at the organization level, is allowing/denying spe-cific external traffic.
• There is a global network firewall policy with rules that enforce intrusion prevention sys-tem (IPS) capabilities for specific external inbound/outbound traffic.
• The VPC firewall rules allow internal communication from RFC 1918 defined subnets communications.
• The VPC firewall contains an explicit deny rule with logs enabled.

This configuration was successful in multiple preexisting VF'Cs. However, you noticed that the logs were missing when you were reviewing a newly created VPC. All external communications are hanging, but internal traffic is working as expected. You want to fix the connectivity issue.

What should you do?

**A:** Create a new VPC and migrate existing resources to the new VPC. Delete the old VPC, and reapply the firewall policies and rules in the newVPC.

**B:** Raise the priority numbers of the firewall policy rules and lower the priority numbers of the VPC firewall rules.

**C:** Review the order in which the VPC firewall rules and policies are evaluated. If the VPC firewall rules are being evaluated before firewall policies, switch the order.

**D:** Lower the priority numbers of the firewall policy rules and raise the priority numbers of the VPC firewall rules.

## Examtopics Professional Cloud Network Engineer_12 question #48

Your on-premises data center has 2 routers connected to your Google Cloud environment through a VPN on each router. All applications are working correctly; however, all of the traffic is passing across a single VPN instead of being load-balanced across the 2 connections as desired.
During troubleshooting you find:
"¢ Each on-premises router is configured with a unique ASN.
"¢ Each on-premises router is configured with the same routes and priorities.
"¢ Both on-premises routers are configured with a VPN connected to a single Cloud Router.
"¢ BGP sessions are established between both on-premises routers and the Cloud Router.
"¢ Only 1 of the on-premises router's routes are being added to the routing table.
What is the most likely cause of this problem?

**A:** The on-premises routers are configured with the same routes.

**B:** A firewall is blocking the traffic across the second VPN connection.

**C:** You do not have a load balancer to load-balance the network traffic.

**D:** The ASNs being used on the on-premises routers are different.

## Examtopics Professional Cloud Network Engineer_25 question #141

Your organization deployed a mission critical application that is expected to be a new revenue source. As part of the planning and deployment process, you have recently implemented a security profile with the default set of threat signatures provided by Cloud Next Generation Firewall (Cloud NGFW). This application is the only application running on this project. You need to increase the security posture of the application to log the threat and drop the related packets. What should you do?

**A:** Configure a new default threat signature with Deny All to all severity options. Review the logs to understand the impact.

**B:** Set up a Linux VM as the frontend gateway for the application. Create iptables rules to drop all packets, excluding the application port.

**C:** For all severity options (critical, high, medium, low and informational) in the security profile, change the default override action to Deny.

**D:** Configure Cloud Scheduler to run a task that checks the Cloud NGFW logs to verify the threats. Configure the task to create a security profile with each signature ID set to override the default action.
