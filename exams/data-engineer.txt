## Examtopics Professional Data Engineer_61 question #5

MJTelco Case Study -

Company Overview -
MJTelco is a startup that plans to build networks in rapidly growing, underserved markets around the world. The company has patents for innovative optical communications hardware. Based on these patents, they can create many reliable, high-speed backbone links with inexpensive hardware.

Company Background -
Founded by experienced telecom executives, MJTelco uses technologies originally developed to overcome communications challenges in space. Fundamental to their operation, they need to create a distributed data infrastructure that drives real-time analysis and incorporates machine learning to continuously optimize their topologies. Because their hardware is inexpensive, they plan to overdeploy the network allowing them to account for the impact of dynamic regional politics on location availability and cost.
Their management and operations teams are situated all around the globe creating many-to-many relationship between data consumers and provides in their system. After careful consideration, they decided public cloud is the perfect environment to support their needs.

Solution Concept -
MJTelco is running a successful proof-of-concept (PoC) project in its labs. They have two primary needs:
✑ Scale and harden their PoC to support significantly more data flows generated when they ramp to more than 50,000 installations.
✑ Refine their machine-learning cycles to verify and improve the dynamic models they use to control topology definition.
MJTelco will also use three separate operating environments `" development/test, staging, and production `" to meet the needs of running experiments, deploying new features, and serving production customers.

Business Requirements -
✑ Scale up their production environment with minimal cost, instantiating resources when and where needed in an unpredictable, distributed telecom user community.
✑ Ensure security of their proprietary data to protect their leading-edge machine learning and analysis.
✑ Provide reliable and timely access to data for analysis from distributed research workers
✑ Maintain isolated environments that support rapid iteration of their machine-learning models without affecting their customers.

Technical Requirements -
Ensure secure and efficient transport and storage of telemetry data
Rapidly scale instances to support between 10,000 and 100,000 data providers with multiple flows each.
Allow analysis and presentation against data tables tracking up to 2 years of data storing approximately 100m records/day
Support rapid iteration of monitoring infrastructure focused on awareness of data pipeline problems both in telemetry flows and in production learning cycles.

CEO Statement -
Our business model relies on our patents, analytics and dynamic machine learning. Our inexpensive hardware is organized to be highly reliable, which gives us cost advantages. We need to quickly stabilize our large distributed data pipelines to meet our reliability and capacity commitments.

CTO Statement -
Our public cloud services must operate as advertised. We need resources that scale and keep our data secure. We also need environments in which our data scientists can carefully study and quickly adapt our models. Because we rely on automation to process our data, we also need our development and test environments to work as we iterate.

CFO Statement -
The project is too large for us to maintain the hardware and software required for the data and analysis. Also, we cannot afford to staff an operations team to monitor so many data feeds, so we will rely on automation and infrastructure. Google Cloud's machine learning will allow our quantitative researchers to work on our high-value problems instead of problems with our data pipelines.
Given the record streams MJTelco is interested in ingesting per day, they are concerned about the cost of Google BigQuery increasing. MJTelco asks you to provide a design solution. They require a single large data table called tracking_table. Additionally, they want to minimize the cost of daily queries while performing fine-grained analysis of each day's events. They also want to use streaming ingestion. What should you do?

**A:** Create a table called tracking_table and include a DATE column.

**B:** Create a partitioned table called tracking_table and include a TIMESTAMP column.

**C:** Create sharded tables for each day following the pattern tracking_table_YYYYMMDD.

**D:** Create a table called tracking_table with a TIMESTAMP column to represent the day.

## Examtopics Professional Data Engineer_61 question #14

Flowlogistic Case Study -

Company Overview -
Flowlogistic is a leading logistics and supply chain provider. They help businesses throughout the world manage their resources and transport them to their final destination. The company has grown rapidly, expanding their offerings to include rail, truck, aircraft, and oceanic shipping.

Company Background -
The company started as a regional trucking company, and then expanded into other logistics market. Because they have not updated their infrastructure, managing and tracking orders and shipments has become a bottleneck. To improve operations, Flowlogistic developed proprietary technology for tracking shipments in real time at the parcel level. However, they are unable to deploy it because their technology stack, based on Apache Kafka, cannot support the processing volume. In addition, Flowlogistic wants to further analyze their orders and shipments to determine how best to deploy their resources.

Solution Concept -
Flowlogistic wants to implement two concepts using the cloud:
✑ Use their proprietary technology in a real-time inventory-tracking system that indicates the location of their loads
✑ Perform analytics on all their orders and shipment logs, which contain both structured and unstructured data, to determine how best to deploy resources, which markets to expand info. They also want to use predictive analytics to learn earlier when a shipment will be delayed.

Existing Technical Environment -
Flowlogistic architecture resides in a single data center:
✑ Databases
- 8 physical servers in 2 clusters
- SQL Server `" user data, inventory, static data
- 3 physical servers
- Cassandra `" metadata, tracking messages
10 Kafka servers `" tracking message aggregation and batch insert
✑ Application servers `" customer front end, middleware for order/customs
- 60 virtual machines across 20 physical servers
- Tomcat `" Java services
- Nginx `" static content
- Batch servers
✑ Storage appliances
- iSCSI for virtual machine (VM) hosts
- Fibre Channel storage area network (FC SAN) `" SQL server storage
Network-attached storage (NAS) image storage, logs, backups
✑ 10 Apache Hadoop /Spark servers
- Core Data Lake
- Data analysis workloads
✑ 20 miscellaneous servers
- Jenkins, monitoring, bastion hosts,

Business Requirements -
✑ Build a reliable and reproducible environment with scaled panty of production.
✑ Aggregate data in a centralized Data Lake for analysis
✑ Use historical data to perform predictive analytics on future shipments
✑ Accurately track every shipment worldwide using proprietary technology
✑ Improve business agility and speed of innovation through rapid provisioning of new resources
✑ Analyze and optimize architecture for performance in the cloud
✑ Migrate fully to the cloud if all other requirements are met

Technical Requirements -
✑ Handle both streaming and batch data
✑ Migrate existing Hadoop workloads
✑ Ensure architecture is scalable and elastic to meet the changing demands of the company.
✑ Use managed services whenever possible
✑ Encrypt data flight and at rest
Connect a VPN between the production data center and cloud environment

SEO Statement -
We have grown so quickly that our inability to upgrade our infrastructure is really hampering further growth and efficiency. We are efficient at moving shipments around the world, but we are inefficient at moving data around.
We need to organize our information so we can more easily understand where our customers are and what they are shipping.

CTO Statement -
IT has never been a priority for us, so as our data has grown, we have not invested enough in our technology. I have a good staff to manage IT, but they are so busy managing our infrastructure that I cannot get them to do the things that really matter, such as organizing our data, building the analytics, and figuring out how to implement the CFO' s tracking technology.

CFO Statement -
Part of our competitive advantage is that we penalize ourselves for late shipments and deliveries. Knowing where out shipments are at all times has a direct correlation to our bottom line and profitability. Additionally, I don't want to commit capital to building out a server environment.
Flowlogistic's management has determined that the current Apache Kafka servers cannot handle the data volume for their real-time inventory tracking system.
You need to build a new system on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that will feed the proprietary tracking software. The system must be able to ingest data from a variety of global sources, process and query in real-time, and store the data reliably. Which combination of GCP products should you choose?

**A:** Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Dataflow, and Cloud Storage

**B:** Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Dataflow, and Local SSD

**C:** Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud SQL, and Cloud Storage

**D:** Cloud Load Balancing, Cloud Dataflow, and Cloud Storage

**E:** Cloud Dataflow, Cloud SQL, and Cloud Storage

## Examtopics Professional Data Engineer_42 question #121

You have a network of 1000 sensors. The sensors generate time series data: one metric per sensor per second, along with a timestamp. You already have 1 TB of data, and expect the data to grow by 1 GB every day. You need to access this data in two ways. The first access pattern requires retrieving the metric from one specific sensor stored at a specific timestamp, with a median single-digit millisecond latency. The second access pattern requires running complex analytic queries on the data, including joins, once a day. How should you store this data?

**A:** Store your data in BigQuery. Concatenate the sensor ID and timestamp, and use it as the primary key.

**B:** Store your data in Bigtable. Concatenate the sensor ID and timestamp and use it as the row key. Perform an export to BigQuery every day.

**C:** Store your data in Bigtable. Concatenate the sensor ID and metric, and use it as the row key. Perform an export to BigQuery every day.

**D:** Store your data in BigQuery. Use the metric as a primary key.

MJTelco is running a successful proof-of-concept (PoC) project in its labs. They have two primary needs:
✑ Scale and harden their PoC to support significantly more data flows generated when they ramp to more than 50,000 installations.
✑ Refine their machine-learning cycles to verify and improve the dynamic models they use to control topology definition.
MJTelco will also use three separate operating environments `" development/test, staging, and production `" to meet the needs of running experiments, deploying new features, and serving production customers.

Business Requirements -
✑ Scale up their production environment with minimal cost, instantiating resources when and where needed in an unpredictable, distributed telecom user community.
✑ Ensure security of their proprietary data to protect their leading-edge machine learning and analysis.
✑ Provide reliable and timely access to data for analysis from distributed research workers
✑ Maintain isolated environments that support rapid iteration of their machine-learning models without affecting their customers.

Ensure secure and efficient transport and storage of telemetry data
Rapidly scale instances to support between 10,000 and 100,000 data providers with multiple flows each.
Allow analysis and presentation against data tables tracking up to 2 years of data storing approximately 100m records/day
Support rapid iteration of monitoring infrastructure focused on awareness of data pipeline problems both in telemetry flows and in production learning cycles.

CEO Statement -
Our business model relies on our patents, analytics and dynamic machine learning. Our inexpensive hardware is organized to be highly reliable, which gives us cost advantages. We need to quickly stabilize our large distributed data pipelines to meet our reliability and capacity commitments.

CTO Statement -
Our public cloud services must operate as advertised. We need resources that scale and keep our data secure. We also need environments in which our data scientists can carefully study and quickly adapt our models. Because we rely on automation to process our data, we also need our development and test environments to work as we iterate.

CFO Statement -
The project is too large for us to maintain the hardware and software required for the data and analysis. Also, we cannot afford to staff an operations team to monitor so many data feeds, so we will rely on automation and infrastructure. Google Cloud's machine learning will allow our quantitative researchers to work on our high-value problems instead of problems with our data pipelines.

MJTelco Case Study -

Company Overview -
MJTelco is a startup that plans to build networks in rapidly growing, underserved markets around the world. The company has patents for innovative optical communications hardware. Based on these patents, they can create many reliable, high-speed backbone links with inexpensive hardware.

Company Background -
Founded by experienced telecom executives, MJTelco uses technologies originally developed to overcome communications challenges in space. Fundamental to their operation, they need to create a distributed data infrastructure that drives real-time analysis and incorporates machine learning to continuously optimize their topologies. Because their hardware is inexpensive, they plan to overdeploy the network allowing them to account for the impact of dynamic regional politics on location availability and cost.
Their management and operations teams are situated all around the globe creating many-to-many relationship between data consumers and provides in their system. After careful consideration, they decided public cloud is the perfect environment to support their needs.

Solution Concept -
MJTelco is running a successful proof-of-concept (PoC) project in its labs. They have two primary needs:
✑ Scale and harden their PoC to support significantly more data flows generated when they ramp to more than 50,000 installations.
✑ Refine their machine-learning cycles to verify and improve the dynamic models they use to control topology definition.
MJTelco will also use three separate operating environments `" development/test, staging, and production `" to meet the needs of running experiments, deploying new features, and serving production customers.

Business Requirements -
✑ Scale up their production environment with minimal cost, instantiating resources when and where needed in an unpredictable, distributed telecom user community.
✑ Ensure security of their proprietary data to protect their leading-edge machine learning and analysis.
✑ Provide reliable and timely access to data for analysis from distributed research workers
✑ Maintain isolated environments that support rapid iteration of their machine-learning models without affecting their customers.

Technical Requirements -
Ensure secure and efficient transport and storage of telemetry data
//IMG//

✑ Rapidly scale instances to support between 10,000 and 100,000 data providers with multiple flows each.
✑ Allow analysis and presentation against data tables tracking up to 2 years of data storing approximately 100m records/day
✑ Support rapid iteration of monitoring infrastructure focused on awareness of data pipeline problems both in telemetry flows and in production learning cycles.

CEO Statement -
Our business model relies on our patents, analytics and dynamic machine learning. Our inexpensive hardware is organized to be highly reliable, which gives us cost advantages. We need to quickly stabilize our large distributed data pipelines to meet our reliability and capacity commitments.

CTO Statement -
Our public cloud services must operate as advertised. We need resources that scale and keep our data secure. We also need environments in which our data scientists can carefully study and quickly adapt our models. Because we rely on automation to process our data, we also need our development and test environments to work as we iterate.

CFO Statement -
The project is too large for us to maintain the hardware and software required for the data and analysis. Also, we cannot afford to staff an operations team to monitor so many data feeds, so we will rely on automation and infrastructure. Google Cloud's machine learning will allow our quantitative researchers to work on our high-value problems instead of problems with our data pipelines.
MJTelco needs you to create a schema in Google Bigtable that will allow for the historical analysis of the last 2 years of records. Each record that comes in is sent every 15 minutes, and contains a unique identifier of the device and a data record. The most common query is for all the data for a given device for a given day.

Flowlogistic Case Study -

Company Overview -
Flowlogistic is a leading logistics and supply chain provider. They help businesses throughout the world manage their resources and transport them to their final destination. The company has grown rapidly, expanding their offerings to include rail, truck, aircraft, and oceanic shipping.

Company Background -
The company started as a regional trucking company, and then expanded into other logistics market. Because they have not updated their infrastructure, managing and tracking orders and shipments has become a bottleneck. To improve operations, Flowlogistic developed proprietary technology for tracking shipments in real time at the parcel level. However, they are unable to deploy it because their technology stack, based on Apache Kafka, cannot support the processing volume. In addition, Flowlogistic wants to further analyze their orders and shipments to determine how best to deploy their resources.

Solution Concept -
Flowlogistic wants to implement two concepts using the cloud:
✑ Use their proprietary technology in a real-time inventory-tracking system that indicates the location of their loads
✑ Perform analytics on all their orders and shipment logs, which contain both structured and unstructured data, to determine how best to deploy resources, which markets to expand info. They also want to use predictive analytics to learn earlier when a shipment will be delayed.

Existing Technical Environment -
Flowlogistic architecture resides in a single data center:
✑ Databases
8 physical servers in 2 clusters
- SQL Server `" user data, inventory, static data
3 physical servers
- Cassandra `" metadata, tracking messages
10 Kafka servers `" tracking message aggregation and batch insert
✑ Application servers `" customer front end, middleware for order/customs
60 virtual machines across 20 physical servers
- Tomcat `" Java services
- Nginx `" static content
- Batch servers
✑ Storage appliances
- iSCSI for virtual machine (VM) hosts
- Fibre Channel storage area network (FC SAN) `" SQL server storage
- Network-attached storage (NAS) image storage, logs, backups
✑ 10 Apache Hadoop /Spark servers
- Core Data Lake
- Data analysis workloads
✑ 20 miscellaneous servers
- Jenkins, monitoring, bastion hosts,

Business Requirements -
Build a reliable and reproducible environment with scaled panty of production.
//IMG//

✑ Aggregate data in a centralized Data Lake for analysis
✑ Use historical data to perform predictive analytics on future shipments
✑ Accurately track every shipment worldwide using proprietary technology
✑ Improve business agility and speed of innovation through rapid provisioning of new resources
✑ Analyze and optimize architecture for performance in the cloud
✑ Migrate fully to the cloud if all other requirements are met

Technical Requirements -
✑ Handle both streaming and batch data
✑ Migrate existing Hadoop workloads
✑ Ensure architecture is scalable and elastic to meet the changing demands of the company.
✑ Use managed services whenever possible
✑ Encrypt data flight and at rest
✑ Connect a VPN between the production data center and cloud environment

SEO Statement -
We have grown so quickly that our inability to upgrade our infrastructure is really hampering further growth and efficiency. We are efficient at moving shipments around the world, but we are inefficient at moving data around.
We need to organize our information so we can more easily understand where our customers are and what they are shipping.

CTO Statement -
IT has never been a priority for us, so as our data has grown, we have not invested enough in our technology. I have a good staff to manage IT, but they are so busy managing our infrastructure that I cannot get them to do the things that really matter, such as organizing our data, building the analytics, and figuring out how to implement the CFO' s tracking technology.

CFO Statement -
Part of our competitive advantage is that we penalize ourselves for late shipments and deliveries. Knowing where out shipments are at all times has a direct correlation to our bottom line and profitability. Additionally, I don't want to commit capital to building out a server environment.
Flowlogistic wants to use Google BigQuery as their primary analysis system, but they still have Apache Hadoop and Spark workloads that they cannot move to

However, they are unable to deploy it because their technology stack, based on Apache Kafka, cannot support the processing volume. In addition, Flowlogistic wants to further analyze their orders and shipments to determine how best to deploy their resources.

Solution Concept -
Flowlogistic wants to implement two concepts using the cloud:
✑ Use their proprietary technology in a real-time inventory-tracking system that indicates the location of their loads
✑ Perform analytics on all their orders and shipment logs, which contain both structured and unstructured data, to determine how best to deploy resources, which markets to expand info. They also want to use predictive analytics to learn earlier when a shipment will be delayed.

Existing Technical Environment -
Flowlogistic architecture resides in a single data center:
✑ Databases
8 physical servers in 2 clusters
- SQL Server `" user data, inventory, static data
3 physical servers
- Cassandra `" metadata, tracking messages
10 Kafka servers `" tracking message aggregation and batch insert
✑ Application servers `" customer front end, middleware for order/customs
60 virtual machines across 20 physical servers
- Tomcat `" Java services
- Nginx `" static content
- Batch servers
✑ Storage appliances
- iSCSI for virtual machine (VM) hosts
- Fibre Channel storage area network (FC SAN) `" SQL server storage
- Network-attached storage (NAS) image storage, logs, backups
✑ 10 Apache Hadoop /Spark servers
- Core Data Lake
- Data analysis workloads
✑ 20 miscellaneous servers
- Jenkins, monitoring, bastion hosts,

Business Requirements -
✑ Build a reliable and reproducible environment with scaled panty of production.
✑ Aggregate data in a centralized Data Lake for analysis
✑ Use historical data to perform predictive analytics on future shipments
✑ Accurately track every shipment worldwide using proprietary technology
✑ Improve business agility and speed of innovation through rapid provisioning of new resources
✑ Analyze and optimize architecture for performance in the cloud
✑ Migrate fully to the cloud if all other requirements are met

Technical Requirements -
✑ Handle both streaming and batch data
✑ Migrate existing Hadoop workloads
✑ Ensure architecture is scalable and elastic to meet the changing demands of the company.
✑ Use managed services whenever possible
✑ Encrypt data flight and at rest
✑ Connect a VPN between the production data center and cloud environment

SEO Statement -
We have grown so quickly that our inability to upgrade our infrastructure is really hampering further growth and efficiency. We are efficient at moving shipments around the world, but we are inefficient at moving data around.
We need to organize our information so we can more easily understand where our customers are and what they are shipping.

CTO Statement -
IT has never been a priority for us, so as our data has grown, we have not invested enough in our technology. I have a good staff to manage IT, but they are so busy managing our infrastructure that I cannot get them to do the things that really matter, such as organizing our data, building the analytics, and figuring out how to implement the CFO' s tracking technology.

CFO Statement -
Part of our competitive advantage is that we penalize ourselves for late shipments and deliveries. Knowing where out shipments are at all times has a direct correlation to our bottom line and profitability. Additionally, I don't want to commit capital to building out a server environment.
Flowlogistic's management has determined that the current Apache Kafka servers cannot handle the data volume for their real-time inventory tracking system.
You need to build a new system on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) that will feed the proprietary tracking software. The system must be able to ingest data from a variety of global sources, process and query in real-time, and store the data reliably. Which combination of GCP products should you choose?

**A:** Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Dataflow, and Cloud Storage

**B:** Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Dataflow, and Local SSD

**C:** Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud SQL, and Cloud Storage

MJTelco Case Study -

Company Overview -
MJTelco is a startup that plans to build networks in rapidly growing, underserved markets around the world. The company has patents for innovative optical communications hardware. Based on these patents, they can create many reliable, high-speed backbone links with inexpensive hardware.

Company Background -
Founded by experienced telecom executives, MJTelco uses technologies originally developed to overcome communications challenges in space. Fundamental to their operation, they need to create a distributed data infrastructure that drives real-time analysis and incorporates machine learning to continuously optimize their topologies. Because their hardware is inexpensive, they plan to overdeploy the network allowing them to account for the impact of dynamic regional politics on location availability and cost.
Their management and operations teams are situated all around the globe creating many-to-many relationship between data consumers and provides in their system. After careful consideration, they decided public cloud is the perfect environment to support their needs.

Solution Concept -
MJTelco is running a successful proof-of-concept (PoC) project in its labs. They have two primary needs:
✑ Scale and harden their PoC to support significantly more data flows generated when they ramp to more than 50,000 installations.
✑ Refine their machine-learning cycles to verify and improve the dynamic models they use to control topology definition.
MJTelco will also use three separate operating environments `" development/test, staging, and production `" to meet the needs of running experiments, deploying new features, and serving production customers.

Business Requirements -
✑ Scale up their production environment with minimal cost, instantiating resources when and where needed in an unpredictable, distributed telecom user community.
✑ Ensure security of their proprietary data to protect their leading-edge machine learning and analysis.
✑ Provide reliable and timely access to data for analysis from distributed research workers
✑ Maintain isolated environments that support rapid iteration of their machine-learning models without affecting their customers.

Technical Requirements -
✑ Ensure secure and efficient transport and storage of telemetry data
✑ Rapidly scale instances to support between 10,000 and 100,000 data providers with multiple flows each.
✑ Allow analysis and presentation against data tables tracking up to 2 years of data storing approximately 100m records/day
✑ Support rapid iteration of monitoring infrastructure focused on awareness of data pipeline problems both in telemetry flows and in production learning cycles.

CEO Statement -
Our business model relies on our patents, analytics and dynamic machine learning. Our inexpensive hardware is organized to be highly reliable, which gives us cost advantages. We need to quickly stabilize our large distributed data pipelines to meet our reliability and capacity commitments.

CTO Statement -
Our public cloud services must operate as advertised. We need resources that scale and keep our data secure. We also need environments in which our data scientists can carefully study and quickly adapt our models. Because we rely on automation to process our data, we also need our development and test environments to work as we iterate.

CFO Statement -
The project is too large for us to maintain the hardware and software required for the data and analysis. Also, we cannot afford to staff an operations team to monitor so many data feeds, so we will rely on automation and infrastructure. Google Cloud's machine learning will allow our quantitative researchers to work on our high-value problems instead of problems with our data pipelines.
MJTelco's Google Cloud Dataflow pipeline is now ready to start receiving data from the 50,000 installations. You want to allow Cloud Dataflow to scale its compute power up as required. Which Cloud Dataflow pipeline configuration setting should you update?

**A:** The zone

**B:** The number of workers

Your company produces 20,000 files every hour. Each data file is formatted as a comma separated values (CSV) file that is less than 4 KB. All files must be ingested on Google Cloud Platform before they can be processed. Your company site has a 200 ms latency to Google Cloud, and your Internet connection bandwidth is limited as 50 Mbps. You currently deploy a secure FTP (SFTP) server on a virtual machine in Google Compute Engine as the data ingestion point. A local SFTP client runs on a dedicated machine to transmit the CSV files as is. The goal is to make reports with data from the previous day available to the executives by 10:00 a.m. each day. This design is barely able to keep up with the current volume, even though the bandwidth utilization is rather low.
You are told that due to seasonality, your company expects the number of files to double for the next three months. Which two actions should you take? (Choose two.)

**A:** Introduce data compression for each file to increase the rate file of file transfer.

**B:** Contact your internet service provider (ISP) to increase your maximum bandwidth to at least 100 Mbps.

**C:** Redesign the data ingestion process to use gsutil tool to send the CSV files to a storage bucket in parallel.

**D:** Assemble 1,000 files into a tape archive (TAR) file. Transmit the TAR files instead, and disassemble the CSV files in the cloud upon receiving them.

**E:** Create an S3-compatible storage endpoint in your network, and use Google Cloud Storage Transfer Service to transfer on-premises data to the designated storage bucket.
